# Tibia Idle Game
> I do not own any rights, this is just a tribute for the greatest game ever

### Features TO DO  (pr's welcome)
- [ ] Money should stack accordingly to the coin (logic needed, img's already there)
- [ ] The person could enter a name for the main character
- [ ] Floor could change from level to another
- [ ] Create a chat section so user can cast spells
- [ ] Use mana (spells?) and HP (maybe the monster could hit back) status Bar
- [ ] Would be nice to have some tests with Testing Library + Cypress.

### This is a tribute
Thanks Tibia! 🙏

Miss all my Saphira friends. ❤️

Hail Hardcore guild. ⚔️
